# StableCode Instruct Alpha 3b API Implementation

The following Colab notebook presents an implementation using the **stablecode-instruct-alpha-3b** model by [StabilityAI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai) as a Flask (ngrok) based API.

This project was developed as part of the **StableCode 24-hours Hackathon** at [LabLab.ai](https://lablab.ai), with the goal of utilizing the StableCode Instruct Alpha 3b model to create a functional API.

## Getting Started

To run the API, follow these steps:

1. Open the Colab notebook provided: [StableCode Instruct Alpha 3b API Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MEY4gYU5GfoE59mwjcVHgu33QDUPh1Fq#scrollTo=ZDDNqlh2ZmzW).
2. Obtain your Hugging Face access tokens as outlined in the notebook.
3. Run through the notebook, executing the cells sequentially.
4. At the end of the notebook, you will receive an ngrok link which will be your API endpoint.
